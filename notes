- Rules vs Learning
- Real Valued number equals regression
- In both classification and regression we might have two or more inputs
- having more inputs may help your solution
- having more inputs does not change whether it is classification/regression
- regression is dealing with numbers as output (continuous)
- classification is discrete
Linear Regression:
9/6/2023:
- cost functions seem like a good way to measure machine learning problems (and measuring the accuracy of the solution?)

- machine learning specialization - stanford
- kaggle has many open notebooks
- f(x) = wx + b
-      = [ w b ]| x | = dot product notation = wx + b(1)
                | 1 |
- vector notation
- Wi = Wi - alpha*( d(J)dx / d(Wi)dx )
- Theta = Theta(i) - alpha*( d(J)dx / d(Theta(i)dx )
- Useful to do the normalization of X (aka fixing size of X to make it converge)
- We are basically calculating our data points and shifting them inside of a line (maybe a parabola) 
- Calculating the cost function (from kaggle NB) = J = (1 / 2M)[(f(x)-y)^2]
- E is used as SUMMATION notation in below equations
- Wj = (1/M)E(f(Xj)-Yj)Xj
- b = (1/M)E(f(Xi)-Yi)
- theta = theta - alpha * d(J)dx / d(Theta)dx
